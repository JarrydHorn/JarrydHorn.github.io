	<h4><u> Market Sector: Technology </u></h4>
The technology sector is a category of stocks that contain technology-oriented businesses, such as manufacturers producing computer hardware, computer software, or electronics, and technology-oriented service industry companies, such as those providing information technology and business data processing. Examples of technology companies include Apple, Microsoft, and Google.
	<br>
Many technology sector funds focus on only one sub-sector of technology, such as computers, networking, semiconductors, or electronics. However, it is best for most investors to use a broadly diversified technology sector fund.
