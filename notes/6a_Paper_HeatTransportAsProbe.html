	<h4><u> "Heat Transport as Probe of Superconducting Gap Structure" </u></h4>
	This paper by Shakeripour, Petrovic and Taillefer is a good resource for understanding thermal conductivity data for a superconductor. <br>
	The paper gives examples and brief explanations for the temperature and magnetic field dependence of thermal conductivity of fully gapped and nodal superconductors. <br>
	<br> The paper is divided into four sections and a summary, but for now I will only outline the first 2:
	<ol>
		<li> Residual heat conduction as T-> 0
			<ul>
				<li> k generally has 2 terms: linear and cubic. Linear term represents conduction due to thermally activated quasi-particled (e.g. electrons).
				<li> For s-wave SC: k/T -> 0 for T->0 (since thermally activated quasi-particle, TAQP, d.o.s. should go to zero for fully gapped SC)
				<li> For nodal SC: there are residual TAQP d.o.s. at T->0 that are protected by symmetry against disorder and therefore conduct heat
				<li> see figure 1 of <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/11/5/055065/pdf"> [1] </a>
			</ul>
		<br>
		<li> Magnetic Field Dependence
			<ul>
				<li> For s-wave SC: TAQP are located in vortex core, therefore only conduction by tunneling => exponential with field (positive concavity)
				<li> For nodal SC: Conduction is dominated by TAQP outside vortex core (at stated near node) with 2 field dependent processes:
					<ul>
						<li> Doppler shift caused by field-induced superfluid flow results in shift in low-energy d.o.s. proportional to B^1/2 (this effect dominates at low fields)
						<li> Zeeman effect results in shift in low-energy d.o.s. proportional to B (dominates at high fields)
					</ul>
				<li> see figure 2 of <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/11/5/055065/pdf"> [1] </a>
			</ul>
	</ol>
