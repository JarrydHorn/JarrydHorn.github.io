	<h4><u> CVT discussion with John after JAH009 (5 July 2021) </u></h4>
	After JAH009 turned out to be a disappointment, John and I brainstormed some ideas for the next run:
	<ul>
		<li> Using less iodine with the hopes that Ni and Bi will transfer more evenly
		<li> Using Cl as transport agent with same intentions as previous bulled
		<li> Using variable cold zone: start at equal temperature (no gradient) and slowly lower the cold zone until ~40C difference
		<li> Shake up the powders in the ampule to force nucleation sites perhaps this will lead to better crystalizing since it doesn't look like the crystals are forming easily
	</ul>
