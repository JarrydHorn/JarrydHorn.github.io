	<h4><u>  7 July 2021 - Paglione Group Meeting  </u></h4>

	In my discussion, I went over my notes from JAH007, JAH008, JAH009 growths as outlines in <a href="docs/Update_JAH007_JAH008_JAH009.pdf"> this summary. </a>
<br>
<ul>
	<li> JP suggests that we take a good sample like JAH008 or so and basically "reverse gradient" to transfer the Bi back to the other end at a low temperature (may 300-400 C).
		<br> the idea is that we could be left with just the nice needles and remove the "flux"
	<li> JP also likes the idea (his idea previously) of doing an off-stoichiometric trial as well
	<li> JP seemed to agree that Cl may also be a good option
</ul>
During Dan's discussion, the idea of using a Wheatstone bridge (similar to the AC-ECE setup) for thermal Conductivity sounds like an interesting idea
<br> This would be something to consider since we are in the process of planning the VTI TC setup.
<br> I will post a separate note for Wheatstone bridge TC setup.
