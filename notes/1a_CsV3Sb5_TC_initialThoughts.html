	<h4><u> June 29, 2021 - Thoughts on CsV3Sb5 TC experiment </u></h4>

	<ul>
		<li> 2 fold symmetry has been shown to exist in the normal state of CsV3Sb5 despite 6 fold crystal symmetry[1]
		<li> Perhaps we may be able to see a similar symmetry in the superconducting gap? Why would  we?
		<li> Perhaps we may be able to see a similar symmetry in the *large enhancement of K with small fields (10% Hc2)* [2]
		<ul>
			<li> ~ Should we do K(0,theta) & K(100 Oe, theta) at low temperatures then?
			<li> ~ Or K(0,T) for select angles to look at the gap?
		</ul>
		<li> Another question: what is the origin of violating Weiderman-Franz law by 20%? Is this common?
	</ul>
