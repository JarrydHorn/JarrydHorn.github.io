	<h4><u> Notes on Feng's paper on Chiral Flux Phase</u></h4>
	<ul>
		<li> Chiral flux phase has lowest energy *among those states which have charge ordering agreeing with observed*
		<li> The chiral flux phase state:
		<ul>
			<li> Breaks TRS
			<li> Displays anomalous hall effect
		</ul>
		<li> These new materials allow us to *investigate the interplay between topology, superconductivity and e-e- correlations*
		<li> Used nearest neighbor tight-binding-approximation to calculate bands, hopping flux, etc.
		<li> I don't fully understand, but it looks like they were focused primarily on explaining past results?
	</ul>
